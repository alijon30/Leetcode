You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.



class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int):
        stairs_complete = 0
        stairs = 1
        while n>= 0:
            n = n - stairs
            stairs += 1
            if n >= 0:
                stairs_complete += 1

        return stairs_complete
